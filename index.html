            <p>To Whomever It May Concern,</p>

            <br>

            <p>I am searching for a position in the Web Development field, and I know I would be a great addition to your team. You can find my resume attached.</p>

            <br>

            <p>I am a third-year Web Design and Development student at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock and plan to graduate in May 2026. These past 3 years I've profoundly developed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript just to name a few. I am excited to finish my studies and continue to learn wherever I go.</p>

            <br>

            <p>Throughout my three years, I've learned a lot and I have worked on a variety of projects. I've created a multitude of sites and my goal on all of them is to create the most perfect site I can create. I focus on visual appeal, SEO, functionality, accessibility, and so much more. Some examples of my work can be found in the work examples tab of my portfolio. However, an example of my work that I would like to point out is the site me and my group created for the Medici. This project exactly shows everything I do. I approach the project intending to meet the client's needs as well as create the best optimized and visually appealing site I could. </p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>I've been intrigued by Web Design and Development since my Freshman year when I was in search of my major. I've always been more inclined towards the technical side of schooling like the Maths and Sciences, however, I also quite love the creativity of the arts. In view of that it was quite hard for me in the beginning to find that perfect major for me. Until one lucky day when I was reading through all the undergraduate majors, and then there it was Web Design and Development the perfect combination of technical skills and creativity. Due to that, I am extremely passionate about my field. I love learning new things about all facets of my field and I am extremely passionate about working in the field besides skilled veterans and even learning more. </p>
     
            <br>

            <p>Finally thank you for taking the time to review my portfolio, and I am looking forward to connecting with you.</p>

            <br>

            <p>Sincerely,</p>
            <p>Derat Miranda</p>
